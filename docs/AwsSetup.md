## 4. Storing Access Keys Locally
- On your local machine, create a directory named `.aws` in your home directory if it doesnâ€™t already exist.
- Inside the `.aws` directory, create a file named `credentials`.
- Open the `credentials` file in a text editor and add the following content:
    ```
    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID
    aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    ```
- Replace `YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` with the actual values from the previous step.
- In the `.aws` directory, create a file named `config`.
- Open the `config` file in a text editor and add the following content:
    ```
    [default]
    region = eu-central-1
    ```
- If required, replace the region with the region you want to set as default.
