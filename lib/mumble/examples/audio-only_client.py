# A python script to do both listening and talking. This is the basic model
# for an audio-only mumble client.

# Usage:

# Install pyaudio (instructions: https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/#downloads)
# If `fatal error: 'portaudio.h' file not found` is encountered while installing
# pyaudio even after following the instruction, this solution might be of help:
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33513522/when-installing-pyaudio-pip-cannot-find-portaudio-h-in-usr-local-include
#
# Install dependencies for pymumble.
#
# Set up a mumber server. For testing purpose, you can use https://guildbit.com/
# to spin up a free server. Hard code the server details in this file.
#
# run `python3 ./listen_n_talk.py`. Now an audio-only mumble client is connected
# to the server.
#
# To test its functionality, in a separate device, use some official mumble
# client (https://www.mumble.com/mumble-download.php) to verbally communicate
# with this audio-only client.
#
# Works on MacOS. Does NOT work on RPi 3B+ (I cannot figure out why. Help will
# be much appreciated)
